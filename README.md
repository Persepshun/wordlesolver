# wordlesolver
Python program for helping to solve wordle puzzles.


I made this not only to help solve wordle puzzles, but mostly because I wanted to know the possible words that guesses CAN be.
I find this part of solving wordle puzzles the most enjoyable, learning new words and seeing how many words can be formed with only certain letters.

There are probably apps and such that can already do this, but I wanted to make one for myself that did exactly what I wanted it to.

Plans for the future:
I want to a function that gives the probability of each letter being guessed being correct, as the purpose of this program is to see statistics and probablity of potential words more than getting to the actual right answer (which is secondary).
Anyone can google the answer or use AI to solve it, what I want is to learn the probability of different guesses and the potential words an answer can be.
